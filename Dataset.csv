"Yeah I just finished my 30 day trial of FSD and while it is decent, it still struggles a LOT. So much in fact that I can never truly relax. The other day it stopped right in the middle of a turn and just sat there so I took over because If i hadn't, accident waiting to happen. It needs a LOT more work and it is NOT Self-driving in the truest sense of the word. It struggles on highways as well, failing to drive naturally and follow cars at normal distances. Is it worth 8K? No. Is it worth 99 for the month if you're doing a road trip? Hell YES.","Yeah I just finished my 30 day trial of FSD and while it is decent, it still struggles a LOT.

"Driving from CA to MO with FSD was very relaxing.  We would never consider road trips this long without it.

"Thanks Tesla for the 1 month free trial of FSD supervised on my Model X and Model Y.  It blew my mind!  So fun to see how far it has come since 2018 when our Model X couldn't even lane keep without ""ping-ponging"" the lane lines.  First impressions on our first few drives with FSD Supervised was like WOW this is 99% there!  It's going to be a ""march of 9's"" for Tesla now. After about 10 drives in increasing tough conditions though my assessment dropped to eh, maybe more like 85-90% there which is still massively impressive.  Congrats to the AI team.  I'm now a believer that some day soon Tesla's FSD will be safer than humans.","Thanks Tesla for the 1 month free trial of FSD supervised on my Model X and Model Y.  It blew my mind!

"its definitely getting better. I wouldn't say its less stressful than actually driving yourself. yet. 
I do like it for long farm country drives, but for some reason, while approaching a stop sign at 90kph - it waits and applies quite a bit of brake pedal (not just regen) rather than regen to a nice smooth stop. its like it can't see it far enough, yet the stop sign is on the map...","its definitely getting better.

"I used it quite a bit during the month free trial and It was absolutely amazing what it can do but I had to disengage it at least every 5 minutes because it would drive 10 mi/hr faster than it should in a small residential area or it would want to hit a curb on a roundabout. It was really amazing what it could do around pedestrians; being slow and safe and left turns were also incredible, but there's just so many little things that make it seem like it's not ready yet.","I used it quite a bit during the month free trial and It was absolutely amazing what it can do but I had to disengage it at least every 5 minutes because it would drive 10 mi/hr faster than it should in a small residential area or it would want to hit a curb on a roundabout.

"In my opinion, tesla is far beyond just a simple autopiolet.
It does not just maintain monotonous routines like speed and direction. It actively makes decisions to turn and even avoid obstacles essentialy takeing control and becoming the driver.
I would not expect a teacher to be fully responsible for a student drivers split second decision why then are people fully responsible for a machine?
If you have a military device that kills only you can pull the trigger despite it being able to maintain lock. The second you give a machine the option to decide what is or isnt a threat and give it the ability to pull the trigger you cant expect the lerson behind the device to know beforehand what out of many decisions it may likely make. So now not only do you yourself have to identify a threat and danger you now have to identify what the machine is doing makeing your respons time twice as slow makeing you no better than a drunk drivers respons time no matter how good you are.","In my opinion, tesla is far beyond just a simple autopiolet.

I just sent bitcoin for the live event where you are doubling it. Unfortunately I sent less than 0.1 before realizing that lower amounts haven't been spoken about.

Wondering if Mr. Musk would use his influence at Mercedes to find a long stolen car. A little to the background. 1945 under Henry Kissinger who was stationed in my Grandfather's house they took my Grandfather Mercedes Convertible and shipped it to the USA. Ever since I found out about it I try to find it but Mercedes will not help. Since I will never give up as long as I am alive I keep on trying every possible way..,Wondering if Mr. Musk would use his influence at Mercedes to find a long stolen car.

That is for that I am more and more reacting allergic when Tesla¡®s marketing department shows us self driving movies which are not congruent to my experiences with my model 3."

"So first of all; love Tesla Motors, wish I could afford one, (hopefully future Model 3 owner)...

That being said; What is the point of this feature on a plug-in vehicle? Surely Summon doesn't jettison the charging plug out of the car before it leaves the garage or plug it in when it enters... this seems like a terrible feature that would encourage people to leave their car unplugged and result in accidental range issues next time they use the car. Or, at best, forces you to get out of the car, wait for the car to go into the garage, you yourself go into the garage anyway, thus defeating the whole point, to plug it in, and then reverse that whole process on the way out - essentially turning a 2 step process into a 6 step process.","So first of all; love Tesla Motors, wish I could afford one, (hopefully future Model 3 owner)...

"Hey Tesla,
These days police pursuits are daily causing much damage & injury & deaths. There is an Az company which has invented a device mounted to the front of a heavy vehicle that shoots out a web of strapping engulfing the speeders rear tire bringing the pursuit to a safe stop. Called  THE POLICE GRAPPLER BUMPER  it requires a heavy vehicle to act as an anchor. The cybertruck would be  PERFECT  for this as @ 7300lbs it is way heavy enough & is also fast as hell catching runaway speeders will be no problem.  WHY has Tesla not offered a cybertruck police model? It would be a perfect patrol & pursuit vehicle. Lots of room in the bed for all of the cop gear they haul, backseat for prisoners. The premier police dept in the US is California Highway Patrol. They do extensive testing of vehicles for police duty. Many many many agencys use their approval stamp as a guide to purchasing cars for their own depts all across the US. Go talk to them & ask what would be required. There is $$ to be made here. Lots of $$$$.

"Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) is technically only Level 2 automation, despite its name. The car can handle steering, acceleration, and braking, but the driver must remain attentive and ready to take over at all times.

Tesla and Elon Musk have often implied that FSD is close to full autonomy (Level 4 or 5), but regulators and independent tests confirm it still requires human supervision, making it Level 2. Even though Tesla collects vast amounts of driving data and frequently updates its system, it has not yet achieved Level 3 or higher, where the driver could legally disengage from driving.

Other companies, like Mercedes-Benz, have already received official approvals for Level 3 (Drive Pilot in Germany, California, and Nevada), where the driver can fully disengage under specific conditions. Tesla has not yet achieved this certification anywhere.

So, while Tesla's marketing may give the impression that its cars are more autonomous than they actually are, in reality, they still fall under Level 2 automation according to industry and regulatory standards.","Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD) is technically only Level 2 automation, despite its name.

"Tried it during the free preview months and was very unimpressed.  It would just give up merging and drive on the shoulder, take forever turning a corner then start with stupid acceleration, and would constantly turn into the wrong lane - so much more relaxing to drive myself.  Maybe if Musk took a break from ending the world and concentrate on his job, it would be better.  I sure hope the shareholders demand Musk is fired before he sinks what used to be a great company.","Tried it during the free preview months and was very unimpressed.

"I rented a 2023 Model Y for 9 days last year during a trip to the east coast. We drove around NYC, Boston, Ithaca and NJ. Total of about 1400 miles. And I would never buy a Model Y nor any Tesla. We had so many problems with the car on a 9 day trip. From annoying to REALLY annoying to DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS.

1) Front seats good. Rear seats... really uncomfortable.
2) Having to adjust everything via the screen is inconvenient at best and dangerous at worst. Taking your eye off the road to do basic stuff is dangerous
3) Voice recognition is not good. Had to attempt many times for basic requests. I don't have any accent in English at all (born and raised in Colorado) It was pretty bad.
4) The air conditioner stopped working on day 7 so we had to deal with 90+ temperatures in NJ/NYC for the last 3 days of our trip.
5) Phantom braking - The car would sense ""something"" and would just brake for no reason. This happened 3 times in 9 days. Once was on the highway doing about 70 mph.

"I really like the tech, but there are so many inconsistencies that makes it uncomfortable to use. For example whenever there is a merging lane, the car will veer into the ending lane only to abruptly break in confusion before realizing the road continues in the previous. Or whenever entering an underpass with strong lights it will emergency break for no reason. (rear ending risk) It often makes these phantom emergency brakes. It also breaks heavily when there is a large oncoming vehicle in the opposite lane. even if the road is more than wide enough. Almost as if it was trained by people who freak out when passed by a large vehicle. It often confuses the speed limit of the road also, mostly ending up driving way to slow or slowing down quickly on a highway. It also really struggles with winding roads and keeping the speed through a turn, driving way below the recommended speed. Confusing the hell out of other drivers. If this was something i experienced once or twice a year, then perhaps it wouldn't be an issue but its stuff i experience every time i use it.","I really like the tech, but there are so many inconsistencies that makes it uncomfortable to use.

"FSD Supervised is certainly getting more and more of the basics right more and more consistently, especially in these test scenarios.

"I think that having multi- directional cold thrusters (not just for the roadster) on all of the cars for safety reasons would be Amazing. In snowy conditions with black ice and low visibility, cold thrusters will keep you from sliding into the ditch, which can happen even if you're driving super slow. And what if you're in snow or icy conditions spinning your wheels trying to get up a steep driveway with ice on it, or you've slid into a ditch (somehow)? Cold thrusters point forward pushing you out of the ditch instead of needing snow chains or a tow truck.

"Also can you put sensors under the passenger-side dashboard so that someone can play electric drums with the music in the car? I play the drums and have found that most car dashboards (if you're using drum sticks) have a feel very similar to most drum pads. It would be awesome if sensitivity could be adjusted for hand drums or for using sticks. People, especially kids would love it.  So much better than the normal screen entertainment options on long road trips. Plus they are doing something other than just watching a screen.

Also most times it would not engage if the sun was on the side of the car blocking the pillar camera. It worked best at night but would randomly think the hwy speed went from 110km to 80km and would constantly slow down the car.

"The FSD made a terrible mistake in the high-speed cut-out. It was barely holding the minimum distance that (recommends 3) seconds, and it also should not have overtaken the parked car. There could have been a pedestrian walking or a bicycle/motorcycle travelling in the opposite direction that might have been in the blind spot generated by the Tesla in front.

It just assumed that the other driver would not make a mistake and overtook as well. If a person was walking or standing there and you would not hit it, it would still be a violation of the minimum clearance that is needed (Germany ""Mindestseitenabstand"" for pedestrians and cyclists: 50 km/h residential = 1.5m and out of town 2m up to 100 km/h) (USA 3-4 feet). Of course, I don't know the direct perspective and view of the cameras, but I can assume that there definitely was a blind spot. In addition, I want to see this test with different weather conditions and with oncoming traffic to see if it will notice. I also have seen a test where the here demonstrated child would fall over, which can happen. What is FSD doing if someone is disappearing in front of the car and not seen by the cameras anymore? Will it drive over it like the Cruise Robotaxi accident where a pedestrian ended up underneath the front camera and was dragged for 40 feet until stopping? Besides that the currently available cars are missing Key Features like Sensors that are located in these areas that are needed to prevent these kinds of Accidents. Will your software be smart enough for these kinds of situations? I would not call this Full-Self Driving jet.","The FSD made a terrible mistake in the high-speed cut-out.

"I would love for your FSD to be done in a more ""assertive"" highway conditions with traffic merging, a place where to test would be Phoenix, Arizona. Arizona has a problem with their roadways. Their a mess of merging lanes and endless road construction. I have had my 24 MYP have trouble negotiating lane changes and keep the pace of traffic too. Often times on those highways the speed limit will get your killed and Tesla only lets you max 85mph. That's too slow for Arizona highways. Especially the I-10 and 202 area.","I would love for your FSD to be done in a more ""assertive"" highway conditions with traffic merging, a place where to test would be Phoenix, Arizona.

The Tesla mobile app allows owners to interact with their Tesla vehicles remotely. The app can be used for:

Remote control of the car: Lock/unlock doors, start or stop charging, and even control the temperature of the cabin.

Monitoring the car's status: Check the car's location, battery charge level, and usage statistics.

Scheduling Charging & Maintenance: Schedule charging sessions, check supercharger availability, and schedule service appointments.




2. Tesla's Influence on Mobile Devices:

Tesla¡¯s cars integrate with mobile technology through smartphones. Tesla owners can connect their cars with the app on their smartphones to monitor various metrics.

Tesla also uses smartphones to enable features like remote starting, cabin climate control, and security systems. This integration places Tesla vehicles at the intersection of automobiles and the connected mobile ecosystem.



3. Tesla and Mobile Technologies:

In-Car Interface: Tesla vehicles are known for their large, tablet-like touchscreens that serve as the primary interface for controlling most vehicle functions. This includes navigation, media control, and vehicle diagnostics.

Integration with Smartphones: Tesla cars allow for seamless Bluetooth integration with mobile devices for media, calls, and notifications.



4. Tesla Energy Mobile Devices:

While not directly related to smartphones, Tesla is expanding its ecosystem of mobile devices for clean energy management. For example, with the Tesla Solar and Powerwall, homeowners can monitor and control energy usage from their mobile devices.




Key Features of Tesla¡¯s Technological Ecosystem:

Over-the-Air Software Updates: As mentioned, Tesla vehicles constantly improve and gain new features through over-the-air updates, allowing the car's system to evolve and adapt over time.

Energy Integration: Tesla's mobile app can control not only the vehicle but also other Tesla products, like solar panels and the Powerwall (home energy storage system), creating a seamless ecosystem for sustainable energy.

Autonomous Driving Technology: Tesla's focus on self-driving technology is expanding into mobile technologies, with potential future integration of fully autonomous vehicles controlled via a mobile interface.


Conclusion:

Tesla is pioneering the future of electric cars with a lineup of high-performance electric vehicles, such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, and is about to redefine the pickup truck market with the Cybertruck. Tesla's focus on innovation, particularly with regards to autonomous driving, battery technology, and software updates, continues to set them apart. Although Tesla doesn't make mobile phones, its ecosystem of mobile apps and tech integration offers a glimpse into a connected future where vehicles, energy management, and mobile devices interact seamlessly."

"This is weird,  but I have this strange desire for Musk to take a page from the Mercedes C-class and have the interior adjusted for maximum sound quality. My belief is that the Bowers & Wilkins Diamond series (speakers) are the best in the market. However,  when doing a comparison between the B&W speakers in an Aston Martin vs the Mercedes C-class, people say the C-Class wins. I don't think it's because of the quality of the speakers.  In fact,  B&W diamond speakers are way better.  It's just the fact that the C-Class interior was designed with from the ground up with sound quality being paramount. It's not a side design element.  In other words, they didn't put the speakers in the standard areas,  and then simple use high quality speakers in those standard places. They put the speakers into,  sometimes,  very non- standard places for the maximum sound experience.  Obviously,  I think it would be absolutely dreamy for Musk to purchase Bowers & Wilkins for use on Tesla cars AND design the interior with absolute top sound quality as a paramount priority. B&W speakers are the choice of John Williams (composer), George Lucas (in his sound studios for reproducing super accurate sound recordings), and Abbey Road Studios (where the Star Wars sound track was created). They use the Diamond series speakers in the studio sound room for playback of the recordings.  B&W speakers are absolutely dreamy. They use real diamonds (manufactured diamonds) in the speakers. I thought it was a gimmick (""ooh diamonds.. ..."") until I heard them for myself. There's nothing like them. They are absolutely incredible. They would make the Tesla the absolute perfect riding experience. Also, it would be cool if Tesla reverse engineered the Mercedes Maybach suspension, for an incredibly smooth ride. There would be NO car on the planet offering a better riding experience.

Obviously,  I think it would be absolutely dreamy for Musk to purchase Bowers & Wilkins for use on Tesla cars AND design the interior with absolute top sound quality as a paramount priority. B&W speakers are the choice of John Williams (composer), George Lucas (in his sound studios for reproducing super accurate sound recordings), and Abbey Road Studios (where the Star Wars sound track was created). They use the Diamond series speakers in the studio sound room for playback of the recordings.  B&W speakers are absolutely dreamy. They use real diamonds (manufactured diamonds) in the speakers. I thought it was a gimmick (""ooh diamonds.. ..."") until I heard them for myself. There's nothing like them. They are absolutely incredible. They would make the Tesla the absolute perfect riding experience. Also, it would be cool if Tesla reverse engineered the Mercedes Maybach suspension, for an incredibly smooth ride. There would be NO car on the planet offering a better riding experience.  PERIOD."

Autonomous driving does yes require basic sensible driving and rockets require basic balance and thrust design and workings. However in the r&d process I think they should put both the rockets and cars on computers through the wars in gameafied dynamic environments as to tweak AI and design understanding. A bit like wind tunnels for cars. btw I would love to talk more about identifying solving any issues with this business. I might not have all the answers but I might have few practical suggestions that may have been over looked. As for the C02 the most efficient thing I can think to do about it is working becteria fungus and sustainable energy together to rapidly grow bio mass for bio mass products even high sugar content to include biodegrading plastics in the process(2 birds with one stone) or even soil products. Some bacteria are way more efficient than plants and fast growing fungi could work with this. If you want to actually get me thinking about problems you have and to see if I have any useful thoughts find me as I say I would love to chat even over email. It would be nice to work two ways to co-ordinate more optimally rather than you just cherry pick from mine and others thoughts.,Autonomous driving does yes require basic sensible driving and rockets require basic balance and thrust design and workings.

"The concept of the car being self-driving, can definitely be an issue. Even if it was accurate where you didn't have to worry about any crashes, it could make you more likely to be on your phone and not pay attention if the automated system does your driving, and or where you take a nap during the drive. However, there are youtube videos of cops pulling people over and giving them tickets for sleeping behind the wheel of a self automated car, so all this is likely to do, if that continues to be the case, is give cops the chance to write out more tickets, even if the person is on their phone during the drive if you aren't allowed to sleep or be on your phone either during the drive, and if that's the case, then it's a pointless feature, because also, even if there are people who are going to say something like ""well, oh, um, you gotta be awake and look like your driving"", even if you did that, that would feel weird. The very idea of you needing to look like you're driving when yet you're not, having your hands on the wheel even though you're not driving it, it's going to be pointless to you, and you are going to, sooner or later, eventually, at some point, nap or be watching videos on a laptop or a smartphone instead of driving if the car's doing your driving.

Self-driving cars are not a good idea until all of the bugs are worked out, and where you don't have to worry about a cop pulling your over just because you're watching a Jake Paul video on youtube. If you can't be doing, or appear to be doing, stuff, other than driving, without getting a traffic ticket, then self-driving cars are nothing more than bait to get people to have traffic tickets written.","The concept of the car being self-driving, can definitely be an issue.

"Enstein once said, 

When the technology will reach a point of doing things for you,  then human beings will loose alot of skills and sences and will become more and more stupid and lazy

The more you use technology to do things for you,  the more you will be unable to do things that before people used to do it easly. 

Example: parallel parking, yess  technology will park the car for you, it looks awesome  but the reality is, after just one year of not doing this simple exercise you will loose that skill to paralle park.  This is just a little example . 

Another example: what most people do when they think they are lost, first they panic and then  they use Google maps to recover their position and suddenly they are not lost and everything is fine.  Instead doing that, remain  calme use your sences, open your eyes and try to remember some key areas you will find a way , by doing that you will increase your sences and you will be able to trust more your self. We are loosing that more and more. 

So if someday you let your car drive for you.  Then I think you are in deep shit my friend","Enstein once said,

"Auto pilots have existed for a long time. The first auto pilots I remember were sailing auto pilots. They were mechanical contraptions one could disconect at will, but we're very useful for tired sailors. Today airliners autopilots are a real danger to comercial aviation. They stand between the cockpits controls and the control surfaces actuators, and the human 'captain' cannot supersede the automatic control of the airplane. There is no longer a mechanical link between the manual control and, say, the rudder or the flaps, or the engines throttle for that matter. Mind You, airplane autopilots are 'state of the art' machines and cost hundred of thousands of dollars more than a Tesla car.
Lately, we have had repeatedly, accidents caused by autopilot malfunction, and there was nothing the human pilot could do to regain control of his aircraft, thus total loss of life!!
The autopilot for a car costing a few tens of thousands of dollars, is of much lesser quality than an airplane autopilot, and thus more prone to error. Do you really want your family safety depending on a cheap autopilot, that can override the use of the brakes or accelerate the engines out of control? Do You?","Auto pilots have existed for a long time. The first auto pilots I remember were sailing auto pilots.

"The term ""Self-Driving"" in this day and age is a misnomer. Yes, it is driving, but it's not driving by itself. It's using a constant satellite connection that provides the directions and it's constantly sending its geo-location back to the neural network. Also if there had happened to be some sort of road maintenance or accident along the way, the driver would have had to re-engage at some point. With a perfectly unobstructed path, no problem - but that's not the norm in most places. For it to be able to be Fully Self-Driving, it would have to be able to make decisions apart from stop signs, stop lights, relative traffic, and pedestrians. Are they getting close? Yes. Will it happen in our lifetime? Probably not.","The term ""Self-Driving"" in this day and age is a misnomer. Yes, it is driving, but it's not driving by itself.

"Why is that all the self-drive car manufacturers are racing on who makes the car that can adapt best to our "" existant "" road infrastructure system , I feel they're looking at the problem the wrong way because the only way to insure the drivers safety and the passer-by's  is to adapt the roads infrastructure to self-drive vehicles   and not the other way round . 
They can start by designing a special lane for these cars . Equipped with all the stuff ( Sensors , GPS , Signage etc ) and once these cars will follow one another on a lane separate for traditional cars  it will be easier for manufacturers to equip their cars to better communicate with one another like keeping  a distance limit between them and regulating speed ect . It's better than trying to put a self drive car in the middle of regular cars ! There's  just too many variables to think about . 
Once they try this method , then gradually they can switch the whole roads infrastructure network to be automated as all cars will have a self drive option by then  . This process can be applied at least in urban areas with a higher traffic rate .
Once outside the city one can drive on a regular non automated network and switch to manual if they wish or self drive for that matter .
Such approach would decrease accidents and insure a better flow of traffic among self drive vehicles . 
The advantage of such a "" Smart road network "" is that it can make people use less cars as there will be lanes for shuttles and taxis people could share ,  and lanes for emergency and express deliveries etc . when someone enters the city he could park his car outside the city limit in an "" automated parking "" than switch to the automated public transportation  network which will be so efficient he won't need his car whilst in the city .
Once he's done in the city he could pick up his car and go about his business  in self drive or manual in a traditional road .","Why is that all the self-drive car manufacturers are racing on who makes the car that can adapt best to our "" existant "" road infrastructure system , I feel they're looking at the problem the wrong way because the only way to insure the drivers safety and the passer-by's  is to adapt the roads infrastructure to self-drive vehicles   and not the other way round .

It was a bit scary at first to let go the wheel, but eventually I got comfortable in letting it go.  Tesla does recommend you to keep your hands on the wheel at all times.  The car slows down when a car cuts in front of you, and when you signal to switch lane, it senses to see if there are obstacles next to you, then it changes lane.

Everything about that car is well designed.  My only worry are hackers getting into the computer of the car.  Other than that, I would get this car in a heartbeat (if I have the money)."

I am a valet for an exclusive restaurant in west hollywood, tmz kind of stuff, so I get to park a lot of nice cars, and this is by far the coolest one (including Aston Martin, Rolls, Bentley, Porsche... range rover, bmw, mbenz, etc..). The only problem is that this is also the only car that scrapes the bottom when exiting the underground parking, at the end of the ramp (in between the two wheel axles). I hope they fix that, just an extra umph of ground clearance and that's it. Approach and departure angle are ok but an extra bit of room for approach angle would not hurt anybody. I guess this will not be a problem with the model X which I can't wait to park!","Best car out there.

"My one issue about Tesla is that the cars don¡¯t look very sophisticated given the price tag.  The colors are garish. They should team up with a chic paint company like Benjamin Moore or Farrow & Ball to have the cars in eg teal blue, burgundy or neutrals.  The inside looks cheap &  plasticky and the outside front looks ugly.  They should focus on their designs, making them look luxurious must haves. This is not an expensive fix but would make a big difference.  When Steve Jobs focussed on design, his sales soared.  Not everyone lives in a big bland box house, Elon!","My one issue about Tesla is that the cars don¡¯t look very sophisticated given the price tag.  The colors are garish.
